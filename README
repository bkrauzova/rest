This is a sample tntnet project using autotools.

The project is split into a library, which should contain the business logic
and a webapplication, which represents the presentation layer.

As an example a class "Foo" in the namespace "my" was generated and put into
the session scope of a web form.

To compile the application, run ./autogen.sh once, which generates a
configure script. Running the configure script generates Makefiles.
Running make, finally compiles the application.

To run the application, change to the webapp directory and enter "tntnet".
You find your webapplication on port 8000.

You may want to add your e-mail adress to the AC_INIT macro in configure.in.
